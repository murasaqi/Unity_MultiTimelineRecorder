=== Test Execution Log ===

[14:25:00] Test run started
[14:25:00] Running Edit Mode tests for BatchRenderingTool.Editor.Tests
[14:25:01] Edit Mode tests completed - Pass: 48, Fail: 3
[14:25:01] Running Play Mode tests for BatchRenderingTool.Runtime.Tests
[14:25:02] Play Mode tests completed - Pass: 3, Fail: 1
[14:25:02] Test run finished - Overall result: Failed

=== Analysis ===

1. AOV Recorder tests are failing due to missing HDRP package dependency
2. FBX Recorder frame rate configuration has incorrect default (24fps instead of 30fps)
3. Timeline playback test is failing possibly due to Play Mode state or timing issues

=== Recommendations ===

1. Install HDRP package or update AOV tests to handle missing dependency
2. Fix FBX Recorder default frame rate to 30fps
3. Review Timeline_TimeProgresses test for proper Play Mode handling
