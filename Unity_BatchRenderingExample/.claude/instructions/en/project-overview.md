# Project Overview

This is a Unity 6000.0.38f1 project that implements a comprehensive batch rendering tool for Unity Timeline. The project uses the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and provides advanced recording capabilities for various formats including images, movies, FBX, Alembic, animations, and AOV (Arbitrary Output Variables).

The Batch Rendering Tool is a complete editor extension that allows users to render multiple Timelines sequentially with full control over output formats, resolutions, and rendering settings.
